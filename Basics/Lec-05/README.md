# Consensus Algorithms in Blockchain

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks. In DPoS, stakeholders vote to select a small group of delegates who are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks. These delegates take turns producing blocks and are incentivized to act honestly because they can lose their position if they misbehave. DPoS aims to achieve both decentralization and efficiency by allowing stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process while delegating the responsibility of block production to a smaller group of trusted individuals.

These are key participants in a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism:

1. **Voters:** Individuals or entities who hold tokens and participate in the governance of the blockchain network by voting for block producers.
2. **Block Producers:** Entities responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks in the blockchain.
3. **Delegators:** Token holders who delegate their voting power to trusted block producers.
4. **Validators:** Entities responsible for validating transactions and securing the blockchain network.

In Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), the reward system typically works as follows:

1. Block producers (validators) are rewarded for their efforts in securing the network and producing blocks.
2. The reward is usually in the form of transaction fees and/or newly minted tokens.
3. The specific reward allocation may vary depending on the protocol and governance rules of the blockchain network.
4. Delegators who vote for the elected block producers may also receive a portion of the rewards generated by the validators they support, incentivizing participation in the network governance.
5. Reward is distributed proportionally, not equally.

## Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
PBFT stands for Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, which is a consensus algorithm designed to achieve consensus in distributed systems even in the presence of Byzantine faults, where nodes may fail or behave maliciously.

In PBFT, a leader node proposes a block, which is then validated by other nodes in the network through a series of pre-defined steps, including pre-prepare, prepare, commit, and execute phases.

Once a supermajority of nodes (two-thirds(66.67%) or more) agree on the proposed block, it is considered committed and added to the blockchain. PBFT ensures safety, liveness, and consistency in the distributed network, making it suitable for applications requiring high throughput and low latency, such as permissioned blockchains and distributed databases.

**Terminology in PBFT**
- Pre-Prepare: The initial step where the primary sends a proposed sequence of transactions to all replicas.
- Prepare: Replicas send a confirmation for the proposed sequence of transactions.
- Commit: Replicas send a final commitment to include the proposed sequence of transactions in the blockchain.
- View Change: Mechanism to handle primary failure by initiating a view change protocol to select a new primary.
