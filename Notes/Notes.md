Problem: Mostly Databases are insecure, not reliable, and data can be corrupted becasue it can be changed.


Solution: A sytem that is decentralized and shared with everyone. Changing data is near to impossible.

In 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto create bitcoin with the help of blockchain. 

Basiclly Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust

BLockchain is a chain of blocks(record, information or relevant data depends on use cases)

A block contains:
- Relevant Data
- Hash
- Previous block Hash

Security: to change data of one block one has to change the data of whole chain and the chain's copy is available to people so that has to be changed too. It takes 10 minutes to change one block information in bitcoin.

Proof of Work. blockchain has this security features called proof of work. It says that to change information or data a proof of work is required which can be time duration of 10 mins or 20 mins.


Consesus Rule: When adding new data or new block, you need to show the proof of work and the you have to share it with the network and if that if majority(more than 50% votes)  agrees on the new block of information only then it can be added.


Bitcoin has eleminated the middle man of the bank in the transactions that's why it is cheap. bitcoin to bit coin can easily be converted.

othe use cases of block chain:
- notarizaation
- Hospital managent system


smart contract: legal contracts 
- etherium 
- solidity
