# Blockchain: Decentralized and Distributed System

## Nodes in Blockchain

In blockchain, a node refers to any device that participates in the network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions. Nodes can be run by individuals, organizations, or entities, and they play a crucial role in the decentralized nature of blockchain networks.

## Decentralized System:
- **Definition**: A decentralized system is one in which authority and decision-making are distributed across multiple nodes or participants, rather than being concentrated in a single central authority.
- **Characteristics**:
  - No Single Point of Control: In a decentralized system, there is no single point of control or failure. Instead, control is distributed among multiple nodes, reducing the risk of censorship, manipulation, or failure.
  - Redundancy and Resilience: Decentralization provides redundancy and resilience to the system, as it can continue to function even if some nodes fail or are compromised.
  - Increased Trust and Transparency: Decentralization enhances trust and transparency by allowing participants to verify and validate transactions independently, without relying on a central authority.

## Distributed System:
- **Definition**: A distributed system is one in which computation, storage, and communication are spread across multiple nodes or computers, often geographically dispersed, that work together to achieve a common goal.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Parallel Processing: Distributed systems enable parallel processing of tasks across multiple nodes, leading to improved performance and scalability.
  - Fault Tolerance: Distributed systems are designed to tolerate faults and failures by distributing data and computation across multiple nodes. This ensures that the system remains operational even if individual nodes fail.
  - Scalability: Distributed systems can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to the network, allowing them to handle increasing workloads and accommodate growing user bases.

## Decentralized and Distributed System:
- **Benefits**: By combining decentralization and distribution, blockchain provides benefits such as increased trust, transparency, security, and resilience. It enables peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, reduces the risk of fraud and manipulation, and ensures the integrity and availability of data.

## mempool
- The mempool, short for **memory pool**, is a temporary storage area in a blockchain network where pending transactions wait to be confirmed and added to the blockchain. Miners select transactions from the mempool to include in blocks they mine, prioritizing transactions based on factors like fees and network congestion. It serves as a critical component in the transaction lifecycle of a blockchain network.
